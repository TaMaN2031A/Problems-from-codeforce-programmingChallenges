// Put the first at 2, second at 2 + 1/3 of the distance from 2 to n, and third is already at n
// This guranteed the biggest differences
// You can calculate differences, they will be 2, n-2+n/3, (n-2+2)/3 // n-2+2 is similar to ceil function
// You can notice that it wil be always n/3-2 the minimum result of the final subtracting operation
